# Google-Search-Algorithm

PageRank (PR) is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank websites in their search engine results based on their importance.

How Google Search Algorithm Works?
The Google Search Algorithm works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of the website’s importance. The underlying assumption is that the most important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites.

With the amount of information available on the web, finding what you need would be next to impossible without some help sorting it out. The Google search algorithm is designed for sorting hundreds of billions of web pages in our search index to find the most relevant result in a matter of seconds and showcases them to you in a way that helps you find what you are looking for.

These ranking systems are made up not of one, but a whole series of algorithms. To give you the most useful information, search algorithms look at many factors, including your query words, page relevance and usability, source expertise, your location, and your settings.

The weight applied to each rankings factor varies depending on the nature of your keyword. For example, content freshness plays a bigger role in responding to queries on current hot topics than dictionary definitions.

Implementing Google Search Algorithm with Python
For the implementation of the Google search algorithm with Python, we must first introduce how to visualize the structure of the World Wide Web. The idea is that WWW can be represented as a huge network, where websites are nodes and their links between them are edges. So let’s set up our WWW in a simplified way, imagining that there are only 4 websites, A, B, C and D.
